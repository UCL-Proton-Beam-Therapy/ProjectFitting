# Project Fitting

This repository will present the step-by-step necessary components needed to perform curve fitting within FPGA. 
This purely VHDL and simulation based FPGA coding to present important components is being described separately. 

Contains:
1. Linear Fitting using Least Squares Method
2. Read Data File.
